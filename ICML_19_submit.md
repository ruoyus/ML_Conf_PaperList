[Sorting Out Lipschitz Function Approximation](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/anil19a/anil19a.pdf) 
Based on this, we propose to combine a gradient norm preserving activation function, GroupSort, with norm-constrained weight matrices. We show that norm-constrained GroupSort architectures are universal Lipschitz function approximators
